Where did our dream disappear?
Look at little Erica
All she learns today is the fear
You deny the truth
You just having fun
Till your child will shoot your gun

Nobody hurt no one
Nobody hurt no one, anybody

Nobody hurt no one, yeah, yeah…

She didn’t wanna go to school
Didn’t wanna face all this pain

I am scared, the boys are insane
Don’t you dare to say
Her reaction is dumb
Cause she had no place to run

Nobody hurt no one
Nobody hurt no one, anybody
Nobody hurt no one
Nobody hurt no one, yeah-yeah…

Nobody hurt no one
You deny the truth
You just having…
Nobody hurt no one
Till your child will shoot your gun
Nobody hurt no one
So please don’t hurt anyone
Nobody hurt no one

Hello sweet America, where did our dream disappear?
Look at little Erica, all she learns today is the fear
You deny the truth, you're just having fun
'Till your child will shoot your gun
Nobody hurt no one
Nobody hurt no one, anybody
Nobody hurt no one
Nobody hurt no one
She didn't wanna go to school, didn't wanna face all this pain
Oh, mummy, can I stay at home? I am scared, the boys are insane
Don't you dare to say her reaction's dumb
'Cause she had no place to run
Nobody hurt no one
Nobody hurt no one, anybody
Nobody hurt no one
Nobody hurt no one
Nobody hurt no one
You deny the truth, you're just having...
'Till your child will shoot your gun
So please don't hurt anyone
You deny the truth, you're just having fun
'Till your child will shoot your gun
Don't you dare to say, her reaction's dumb
'Cause she had no place to run
Nobody hurt no one
Nobody hurt no one
Nobody hurt no one
Nobody hurt no one
Nobody hurt no one
So please don't hurt anyone
Nobody hurt no one
So please don't hurt anyone
Nobody hurt no one
Nobody hurt no one

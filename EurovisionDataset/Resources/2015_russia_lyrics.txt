We are the world's people
Different yet we're the same
We believe
We believe in a dream
Praying for peace and healing
I hope we can start again
We believe
We believe in a dream
So if you ever feel love is fading
Together like the stars in the sky
We can sing
We can shine
When you hear our voices call
You won't be lonely anymore
A million voices
Your heart is like a beating drum
Burning brighter than the sun
A million voices
Now as the world is listening
From cities and satellites
We believe
We believe
In a dream
If you ever feel love is fading
Together like the stars in the sky
We can sing
We can shine
When you hear our voices call
You won't be lonely anymore
A million voices
Your heart is like a beating drum
Burning brighter than the sun
When I look around at these faces
I can see the stars in the sky
We will sing
We will shine
Singing out
Singing out
Ooh
Singing out
Singing out
Ooh
Singing out
A million voices
